# JS-CommercialDemo
Simple site imitating amazon shop (somewhat).


# Folder structure

By default whole project is placed inside the 'app' folder. (App sometimes is called root - because it's the root of the project).

 >> Scripts - contains all js Scripts
 >> styles - contains all css/scss files
 >> assets - contains all graphical assets  used in the project
